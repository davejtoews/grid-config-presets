# Silverstripe Gridfield Config presets

A collection of configurations making use of [orderable rows](https://github.com/symbiote/silverstripe-gridfieldextensions/blob/3/docs/en/index.md#orderable-rows). These configurations also default to putting the buttons after the grid - a personal preference when including gridfields on CMS pages that also contain other fields.

## Install

`composer require davejtoews/grid-config-presets`
